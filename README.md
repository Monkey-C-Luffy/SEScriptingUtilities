# SE Scripting Utilities
This is a project that intends to provide a solution for common actions required in SE Scripting.
I do not claim to be the best coder,but I try my best.  
This project is not guaranteed to be actively maintained,I generally intend to work on improving/modifying this  
on my spare time and whenever it seems something needs to be modified.

## Setup
To setup your SE Scripting Utilities project:
1. You first download the latest release as a zip.
2. Then extract that zip preferably inside your visual studio solution folder for your script.
3. The folder should contain a shared project file(.shproj) and the source code.
4. All you then have to do is,right click on your visual studio solution in your Solution Explorer and add **existing** project,find the shared project and add it. 
5. Right click on references in your script project,and add reference,find the shared project.

This should be it!All done!

## Using With Malware Dev's Extension
It is highly advised to reduce the final lines of your script,by enabling the MDK option **Remove Unused Types**
