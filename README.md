# SE Scripting Utilities
This is a project that intends to provide a solution for common actions required in SE Scripting.
<p>I do not claim to be the best coder,but I try my best.
This project is not guaranteed to be actively maintained,
I generally intend to work on improving/modifying this on my spare time and whenever it seems something needs to be modified.</p>

# Setup
<p>You first download the latest release as a zip.<br/>
Then extract that zip preferably inside your visual studio solution folder for your script.<br/>
The folder should contain a shared project file(.shproj) and the source code.<br/>
All you then have to do is,right click on your visual studio solution in your Solution Explorer and add <b>existing</b> project,find the shared project and add it.<br/>
This should be it!All done!
